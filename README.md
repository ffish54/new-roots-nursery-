# New Roots Nursery Website

## Project Overview
this project is an advertisement  website for my family's small plant nursery. the projects goal is to create a website that can advertise and provide information about the nursery and plants sold to potential customers in the local area. 

My family grows many plants, and we are planning on selling many of our excess or specific plants we have grown to sell, at first we primarily sold from Facebook marketplace this works but as our small business grew, I thought I could develop a website to advertise and inform potential local customers about our business as we could post links to this website in popular online areas for the community and link to the site through leaflets, this will increase the awareness of our business to the community, which may result in more customers

## Design

### Design Choices 
I am planning to have a green colour scheme, as green represents plants, and a few browns to represent earthy tones for dirt and soil. I am planning on adding many images of plants we have grown to show customers the quality and look of different plants. I plan on having a stylised background of a floral or vine pattern to make the website more appealing. I plan to use smoother angles on sections and images to make the website fit with the calm nature style. 

### Wireframes
wireframes are attatched to this read me file
<img width="1024" height="728" alt="wireframe_1_about_us_desktop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaf50038-a62d-4361-812e-395b99bc3ce4" />

On the first page, this page should welcome the user and briefly describe the website and buisness. I plan on having a simplistic layout with a navigation section in the heading, each link leads to another page on this website to allow the user to navigate the website, and in the header on the other side of the navigation section, there is a small logo for the website. Below the nave section is a hero image that I plan to showcase a collection of the plants we have. Under this is a welcoming text introducing the website and business of New Roots Nursery. The next text segment explains more about our plants and how we grow and cultivate them, and what types we usually tend to sell. Besides, this is a small image showcasing more of our plants. a text section describing our prices and deals for our plants next to this text is an image showing off more plants and slightly below the text is a button labeled view prices, this button links to the our plants section so a user could easily access this page and view the prices of our plants and quickly see if they want to continue using this website and our business. The last test segment will describe how we are based in Wesbeach and what areas we plan on delivering to. Next to this is another image depicting a few plants we sell, but below this is a button labeled contact us which links to the contact us page, where users can easily access this page and find the information to contact us. At the bottom of the page is a footer with a copyright label I use this to make the bottom feel less empty and make the website seem more professional.

<img width="1028" height="728" alt="wireframe_2_about_us_tablet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/776219eb-11f4-4470-9aed-2e6622384cd3" />

On the tablet the page's layout changes, so each of the text segments are against the sides of the screen due to the smaller size of this screen having the same open space as the desktop style can make the segments seem clustered together, the first and third segment are against the left side and the second is against the right side this is so the the space sill feels evenly used.

<img width="712" height="728" alt="wireframe_3_about_us_mobile" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d27b6cdf-c296-475f-a361-4babebbe26e3" />

On the mobile version of the page the navigation section is changed to have a menu icon that expands when clicked into a drop down list of links to each page because of mobile screens being much smaller it can be difficult to click the links and they can take up too much of the screen, in this version the layout is changed to have each image and text segment stacked in the center due to mobiles small screen size this page likely need to be able to scroll through each segment as they will not all fit on the screen at a suitable size to clearly read the text.


<img width="1024" height="1800" alt="wireframe_4_our_plants_desktop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d27acd-5098-4e58-a3dc-e59c17d24c1a" />

Our plants is the second page of the website. The goal of this page is to showcase all our plants, describe them, and price them so the user can decide if they want to buy some plants. The header includes the logo image and navigation links described earlier, and a small description of our selection of plants just below the navigation header. in rows of three are cards based on bootstrap cards with an image of the plant the name, a small description of the plant how to maintain it and the price each card is for a different plant so there will be a few plants, use of the card segment is used to separate each plant and makes each of them unique and so information isn't confused for different plants, a scroll feature will be added if it is needed from the amount of cards so that the user can easily look through all the different plants if there are too many too fit on the screen.

<img width="1024" height="1800" alt="wireframe_5_our_plants_tablet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e5dcfa0-45ae-4239-ab32-98fd9d950dbb" />

On the tablet version of the Our Plants page, the cards are bigger and have been changed from 3 cards a row to 2 cards a row, as tablets have a slightly smaller screen. This change allows for each card to be bigger in each row, so that the user can easily see each card on the smaller screen 

<img width="746" height="1800" alt="wireframe_6_our_plants_mobile" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a23c6371-32c6-4918-ad38-6d57aad8765f" />

On the mobile version of the Our Plants page, the navigation element has the dropdown menu, the same as the one mentioned earlier in the mobile version of About Us, and the cards fill the screen with one card per row, as mobile screens are much smaller this larger sizes allow users to read the cards with ease.

<img width="1026" height="1296" alt="wireframe_7_contact_us_desktop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/071b62f7-bec0-492b-861d-19e87c0fe85f" />

the third page is the Contact Us page in the headder of this page has the website logo and the navigation section below this is a hero iamage of a large collection of our plants, under this is a text box detailing our contact information the area we are located in, our email, phone number, any scoical media links, and recomened hours to contact us.
