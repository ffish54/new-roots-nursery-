# New Roots Nursery Website

## Project Overview
this project is an advertisement  website for my family's small plant nursery. the projects goal is to create a website that can advertise and provide information about the nursery and plants sold to potential customers in the local area. 

My family grows many plants, and we are planning on selling many of our excess or specific plants we have grown to sell, at first we primarily sold from Facebook marketplace this works but as our small business grew, I thought I could develop a website to advertise and inform potential local customers about our business as we could post links to this website in popular online areas for the community and link to the site through leaflets, this will increase the awareness of our business to the community, which may result in more customers
